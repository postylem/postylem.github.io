<p><em>Warning: walking may have unexpected side effects. Unexpected effects are unexpected, so we don’t expect them. But, adventure at your own risk. Oh, and if you feel like you want to touch anything, maybe don’t. Or consider using a stick or something.  We like sharing exciting tips about your walk around South Natick, we are not all that into sharing viruses.</em></p>
