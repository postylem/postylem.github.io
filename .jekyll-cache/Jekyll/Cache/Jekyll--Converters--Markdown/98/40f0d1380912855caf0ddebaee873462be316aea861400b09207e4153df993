<p>We are Tacko and Jebia, and weâ€™re excited to offer to you our self-guided tour of South Natick. Perfect for Sundays in early May. With our great guide, youâ€™ll be sure to see all the sights we think you should see. And we think thatâ€™s just great!</p>

<p>Letâ€™s go on an adventure! Be sure to keep your neat-o map handy.</p>

<p><em>Warning: walking may have unexpected side effects. Unexpected effects are unexpected, so we donâ€™t expect them. But, adventure at your own risk. Oh, and if you feel like you want to touch anything, maybe donâ€™t. Or consider using a stick or something.  We like sharing exciting tips about your walk around South Natick, we are not all that into sharing viruses.</em></p>
