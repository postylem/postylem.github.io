<p>[Flyingtogether](This is a great wall. Itâ€™s great.  Especially this spot.  We think youâ€™ll agree. Donâ€™t touch it with your hands, but you can touch it with your mind, as long as you wash after.</p>

<p>[Foot](Tacko goes into a trance, in which he does a little dance.</p>

<p>[Lost](Directions, directions. Directions are confusing, even for cool Natick explorers like us. So donâ€™t be too hard on yourselves, folks.</p>

<p>[Math](Walks can exercize your brain too!  Yay!</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>[Nose](If youâ€™re feeling overwhelmed, take some time to take in the scenes from a telephone poleâ€™s point of view.  And lightly tan your schnoz while youâ€™re at it!</p>

<p>[Ournest](Donâ€™t sit at the picnic tables.  But you can look at them.  Ah theyâ€™re quite a sight.</p>

<p>[Path](Allow us to invite you on a strikingly well-maintained leaf-path, which is strikingly well-maintained. Take a saunter or two. Itâ€™s guaranteed.</p>

<p>[Reflect](Walks arenâ€™t all about exercize for your gams. Itâ€™s a spiritual journey too. Take moments for quiet reflection.  Donâ€™t fall off the cliff though. We donâ€™t have cliff insurance!</p>

<p>[Shell](While youâ€™re in this neck of the woods, we recommend a mandatory reading break.  Itâ€™s recommended! Itâ€™s mandatory! Think of it as an errand.  We all like errands.</p>

<p>Puoi imparare cosÃ¬ tanto, leggendo â€¦

<p>Errand done? Yay! So productive. And now you can check that off your to-do list â€” donâ€™t forget to check off any other accomplishments while youâ€™re at it.  We love that feeling!

<p>[Start](You might spot some wildlife on your walk (if youâ€™re doing it right).  Looks like Jebia has sighted an exciting and rare rock in its natural habitat.  See if you can find it, and get a better look (rocks are notoriously slow-moving. Itâ€™s probably still there.)</p>

<p>[Swing](Not everythingâ€™s in perfect working order. Somebody should really fix this important little sign.  But itâ€™s not our job.</p>

<p>[Together](Cross only at a designated crossing, and be sure to look both ways. Safety in numbers.</p>
